Problem Statement:
Traditional fitness tracking methods
often rely on manual input, which can
be imprecise and lead to suboptimal
results, impacting the user's overall
fitness journey.
Your task here is to explore and
develop a state-of-the art pose
estimation system using Computer
Vision and Machine Learning, to be
used in the field of sports and fitness.
You can choose the following use case or
choose your own use cases.
Exercise Recognition:
Rep and Set Counting:
Gym Companion:-
Users often struggle with exercise
recognition and selection. Manual entry
of exercises is error-prone and can
disrupt the flow of a workout.
Leveraging OpenCV and deep learning,
this system offers automated exercise
recognition. Users can seamlessly
perform a variety of exercises, such as
Bench press, Pushup, Bicep Curl,
Lateral Raise, Shoulder Press, and
Squat, without the need for manual
input.
Inaccurate rep and set counting can
hinder the effectiveness of workouts,
leading to under-training or overtraining. Using OpenCV, the system sets
angle thresholds, enabling accurate
counting of repetitions. It also tracks
the number of sets completed,
ensuring users follow their workout
plans with precision.
Progress Tracking:
Fitness enthusiasts often lack a
centralized platform to
comprehensively track and visualize
their fitness progress over time. The
system not only collects and stores
critical user data, encompassing sets,
reps, weight lifted, BMI, and heart rate,
but it also incorporates a data analysis
dashboard. This user-friendly
dashboard allows individuals to
monitor their progress, gain insights
from the collected data, and identify
areas for improvement.
Exercise Recommendations:Users
may need guidance on exercise
selection and workout optimization.
The system utilizes collected data
to offer exercise recommendations
tailored to users' fitness goals,
helping them diversify their
routines and achieve better results.
Warning system: The system
includes a valuable safety feature â€“
a warning system. This system not
only tracks your progress but also
closely monitors your exercise
form. If your form begins to
deteriorate to a point that may risk
injury or hinder the effectiveness of
your workout, the warning system
provides immediate alerts, helping
you maintain a safe and efficient
workout routine.
Additional Brownie Points:
For extra recognition, consider
including the following features or
aspects in the project:
App Integration: The system can be
integrated into a mobile app,
offering real-time feedback and
data accessibility across devices,
potentially connecting with
wearables
